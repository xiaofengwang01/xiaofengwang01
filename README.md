## 👋 About Me

- 🎓 I’m currently a **first-year Master’s student**, working at the intersection of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Chip Design / EDA**.  
- 🧠 My main interest is enabling LLMs to **understand, generate, and repair hardware code (Verilog/SystemVerilog)** — including **completion, debugging, refactoring, and design assistance**.  
- 🧩 I enjoy connecting **traditional EDA flows** with **modern LLM-based workflows**, for example:
  - From **natural language specifications → hardware description (HDL)**
  - From **compiler/simulation error logs → automatic repair suggestions**
- 💡 A question I think about a lot:  
  > “How far can LLMs go in automating *real* chip design and verification workflows?”

- 🧪 Currently experimenting with:
  - Fine-tuning and evaluating **code-oriented LLMs** for Verilog generation & repair  
  - Designing **benchmarks and metrics** for LLMs on EDA-related tasks  
  - Building small tools for **automatic lint fixing, log understanding, and constraint extraction**

---

## 🔬 Research & Interests

- **LLMs for EDA / Chip Design**
  - Code generation & repair for **Verilog/SystemVerilog**
  - Agent-like workflows that integrate LLMs with **simulation / synthesis / lint** tools
  - Prompt & pipeline design for **RTL design, debugging, and verification**

- **Programming Languages, Compilers & Systems**
  - Intermediate representations, basic static analysis, and verification ideas  
  - Interest in **program synthesis, automated debugging, and intelligent tooling**

- **Hardware & Digital Design**
  - RTL design, FPGA experiments
  - Long-term goal: a pipeline that goes from  
    **“natural language requirement → RTL prototype → automated testing/verification”**

## 🧪 Projects & TODOs

> Some ideas and work-in-progress projects. Names are placeholders — feel free to rename to actual repos.

- 🔭 `llm-eda-playground`  
  A playground for experimenting with **LLMs on EDA tasks**, especially Verilog code generation & repair, prompt designs, and pipeline orchestration.

- 🛠 `rtl-auto-fix`  
  A prototype tool that reads **compiler/simulation logs** and proposes **candidate patches** for RTL code (LLM-assisted debugging).

- 📏 `llm-verilog-bench`  
  A small **benchmark and evaluation framework** for Verilog-focused LLM tasks, including generation, mutation, and repair scenarios.

> I plan to open-source more research prototypes, course projects, and tools as they become more stable and interesting.
